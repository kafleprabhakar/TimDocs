Peer-to-peer collaborative text-editor

## Setting up
- Download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download.
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Running the application
- Run `node server/server.js` to start the server in port 1800.
- Run `cd client` and `python -m http.server 9000` to start a http server to run clients. This is not a server. It only provides a simple server-like environment to run the HTML files for client.
